\chapter{Hardware--Native Voting without AND/OR Expansion}
\label{chap:voter}

Threshold (``voting'') gates occur pervasively in fault
and reliability models.  A naive decomposition into pairwise \textsc{and}/\textsc{or}
operations inflates the graph size combinatorially, impeding both memory usage
and kernel launch efficiency.  This chapter develops a hardware-native alternative
rooted in population counting and bit-parallelism. We prove the estimator obtained 
by the direct algorithm is \emph{identical} to
that of the expanded Boolean formula, quantify its computational complexity,
and examine device-specific performance characteristics.  Extensions to
\emph{at-most} and \emph{exactly} voting are treated as corollaries.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We adopt the symbols of Chapter~\ref{chap:mc_solver}.  In particular, a single
Monte–Carlo \emph{iteration} generates $B$ \emph{batches}, each batch contains
$P$ \emph{bit-packs}, and every bit-pack stores $\omega=8\,\mathrm{sizeof}(\texttt{bitpack\_t})$
Bernoulli trials.  Hence an iteration processes
\(
  N = B P \omega
\)
trials per node.

Let $\mathcal{I}=\{X_1,\dots,X_n\}$ be the binary inputs of a voting gate and
fix an integer $k\in\{0,\dots,n\}$.  The gate output obeys the Boolean
predicate (cf.~Eq.~(\ref{eq:kn_gate_boolean}))
\[
  Y\;=\;[\,\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \ge k\,].
\]
We write $\mathrm{VOT}(k/n)$ for the connective and reserve the symbols
$A$ and $G$ for the counts of voting and standard gates, respectively, as in
Table~\ref{tab:kernel_dimensions}.

\section{Logical Equivalence under Bit-Packed Sampling}
\label{sec:voter_equivalence}

Monte–Carlo evaluation ultimately concerns the indicator random variable
$Y(\omega)$ under a random assignment $\omega\in\{0,1\}^{n}$.  Two alternative
computational paths exist:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(E1)] \textbf{Expansion.}  Rewrite $Y$ into the disjunctive normal form
        of Eq.~(\ref{eq:k_of_n_or_of_ands}); evaluate the resulting tree of
        $\textsc{and}/\textsc{or}$ nodes.
  \item[(E2)] \textbf{Threshold test.}  Count $s(\omega)=\sum_i X_i(\omega)$
        and return $[s(\omega)\ge k]$ directly.
\end{enumerate}
Because both (E1) and (E2) are algebraically identical for \emph{every}
assignment $\omega$, the Bernoulli random variables they produce are equal in
distribution:
\(
  Y_{\mathrm{E1}}\equiv Y_{\mathrm{E2}}.
\)
Consequently all unbiased estimators derived from repeated sampling are
identical in expectation and variance.  Sections~\ref{sec:voter_unbiased} and
\ref{sec:voter_variance} formalize these statements.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Unbiasedness of the Direct Estimator}
\label{sec:voter_unbiased}

Let $\widehat{p}_\text{exp}$ and $\widehat{p}_\text{thr}$ denote the
estimators of $p=\Pr(Y=1)$ obtained after $T$ iterations via routes (E1) and
(E2), respectively.  Both take the canonical form
\[
  \widehat{p}\;=\;\frac{s}{T N},
\]
where $s$ is the number of one-bits tallied by the kernel of
Section~\ref{sec:tally_kernel}.  As $Y_{\mathrm{E1}}\equiv Y_{\mathrm{E2}}$, we
have $\mathbb{E}[s_{\mathrm{exp}}]=\mathbb{E}[s_{\mathrm{thr}}]=T N p$ and hence
\(
  \mathbb{E}[\widehat{p}_\text{exp}] =\mathbb{E}[\widehat{p}_\text{thr}] = p.
\)
Thus the direct threshold estimator inherits the unbiasedness of the expanded
approach.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Variance Preservation}
\label{sec:voter_variance}

Because the underlying Bernoulli variables coincide, the sample variance per
iteration is
\(
  \operatorname{Var}[Y] = p(1-p)
\)
for either method.  Aggregating over $T N$ independent trials gives the common
standard error quoted in Eq.~(\ref{eq:p_hat_sigma_hat}).  No variance penalty
is therefore incurred by bypassing expansion.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Bit-Parallel Threshold Algorithm}
\label{sec:voter_algorithm}

We now articulate the algorithmic core executed by the specialized kernel
\textsc{VOT\_Kernel}.  The pseudocode mirrors the exposition of
Section~\ref{subsec:gate_kernel} but tailors the intra-group logic to a
population-count primitive.

\subsection{Per-Lane Counting Model}

Let $(a,b,p,\lambda)$ index a single \emph{lane} as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:gate_kernel}: gate $a\in\{1,\dots,A\}$, batch $b$, bit-pack
$p$, and bit position $\lambda\in\{0,\dots,\omega-1\}$.  Each lane stores an
8-bit counter $c\in\{0,\dots,n\}$ initialized to zero.  For every input buffer
addressed by the gate the lane accumulates
\[
  c\;\leftarrow\;c + [\text{bit}_{\lambda}(X_i)=1] + [\text{bit}_{\lambda}(\lnot X_j)=1],
\]
where positive and negated inputs are treated per
Eq.~(27) of Section~\ref{subsec:gate_kernel}.  After the loop the lane outputs
\(
  y_{\lambda} = [c\ge k].
\)
A work-group reduction (bitwise OR) assembles the final $\omega$-bit word.

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}
\label{sec:voter_complexity}

\subsubsection{Arithmetic intensity.}  Each lane performs $n$ increments and one
comparison, giving $\mathcal{O}(n)$ integer operations per 64 trials.
Comparing to the expanded tree: the latter executes $\Theta(n)$ operations per
\emph{subset} and therefore $\Theta\bigl(\tbinom{n}{k}\bigr)$ overall in the
worst case.  The direct kernel is thus exponentially faster in $n$.

\subsubsection{Memory traffic.}  Input buffers are streamed once, achieving
unit-stride accesses identical to the standard gate kernel.  No additional
buffers are materialized, avoiding the memory blow-up described in
Section~\ref{sec:layered_dag_traversal}.

\subsubsection{Register pressure.}  The counter width is $\lceil\log_2(n+1)\rceil$
bits.  For practical fan-ins $(n\le 255)$ an 8-bit counter suffices, preserving
high occupancy on GPUs.

\subsubsection{Graph-size savings.}  Let one $\mathrm{VOT}(k/n)$ gate be
replaced by its DNF of Eq.~(\ref{eq:k_of_n_or_of_ands}).  The expansion
introduces
\[
  M(n,k) \;=\; \sum_{j=k}^{n} \binom{n}{j}
\]
conjunction clauses plus $M(n,k)-1$ internal $\textsc{or}$ nodes when lowered
onto a binary tree.
Each clause itself maps to one $j$-input $\textsc{and}$ node.  The total
\emph{additional} gate count therefore grows as
\[
  G_{\text{exp}}(n,k) \;=\; \sum_{j=k}^{n} \binom{n}{j}\;\Bigl(1 + (j-1)\Bigr)
  \;\approx\; \Theta\!\bigl(M(n,k)\,n\bigr),
\]
which is maximized at $k\approx\lceil n/2\rceil$ with the asymptotic
behavior $G_{\text{exp}}=\Theta\!\bigl(2^{n}/\sqrt{n}\bigr)$ by Stirling’s
formula.  The direct threshold kernel replaces this entire sub-tree with a
\emph{single} node—yielding an exponential reduction in graph size, memory
footprint, and kernel launch overhead.  For instance, a 3-of-5 gate (cf.
Listing~\ref{sec:3_of_5_voting_logic_example}) collapses from
$G_{\text{exp}}=\binom{5}{3}+\binom{5}{4}+\binom{5}{5}=26$ logic gates to
one, a $26\times$ reduction.  At $n=15$ and $k=8$ the saving increases to
$(2^{15}-1)/2 \approx 16\,383$:1.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Extensions: At-Most and Exact Voting}
\label{sec:voter_extensions}

Two common relatives are the \emph{at-most} gate $\mathrm{ATMOST}(k/n)$ and the
\emph{exactly} gate $\mathrm{EXACT}(k/n)$.  Let $s$ be the per-lane counter as
above.
\[
  \mathrm{ATMOST}(k/n):\; y=[s\le k],
  \qquad
  \mathrm{EXACT}(k/n):\; y=[s = k].
\]
Both predicates are evaluated by a single comparison added after the counting
loop, leaving all complexity results intact.  Unbiasedness and variance proofs
mirror those of Sections~\ref{sec:voter_unbiased}–\ref{sec:voter_variance}.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Device-Specific Performance Considerations}
\label{sec:voter_perf}

\subsection{GPUs}
On NVIDIA Ada-class GPUs the latency of an integer increment is two cycles,
whereas a 32-bit popcount is three cycles.  For $n\le 64$ the counting loop
fits entirely within one warp and the kernel attains the same throughput as a
standard \textsc{or} gate.  For $n>64$ shared-memory tiling as suggested in
Section~\ref{sec:gate_kernel} becomes beneficial.

\subsection{Vector CPUs}
Counting across inputs maps naturally to SIMD horizontal additions.  When $n$
exceeds the lane width ($W_s$ in Section~\ref{subsec:cpu_backend}) we apply a
loop unrolling factor $u=\lceil n/W_s\rceil$ to sustain two vector increments
per cycle, thereby saturating the execution units while hiding memory
latency.
