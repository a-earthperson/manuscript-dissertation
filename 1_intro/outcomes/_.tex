\section{Outcomes \& Related Documents}

A core objective of this research program is open dissemination—code, data, and analysis tools are released under permissive licenses so that the wider \acrshort{pra} community can build upon them.  Many of the outcomes listed below are the result of multi-institution collaborations and student projects; only a subset represent my direct, first-author contributions.
