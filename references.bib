	doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2105.10386},
	abstract = {The subject of this textbook is the analysis of Boolean functions. Roughly speaking, this refers to studying Boolean functions \$f : {\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}\$ via their Fourier expansion and other analytic means. Boolean functions are perhaps the most basic object of study in theoretical computer science, and Fourier analysis has become an indispensable tool in the field. The topic has also played a key role in several other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics, random graph theory, and statistical physics, to Gaussian geometry, metric/Banach spaces, and social choice theory. The intent of this book is both to develop the foundations of the field and to give a wide (though far from exhaustive) overview of its applications. Each chapter ends with a "highlight" showing the power of analysis of Boolean functions in different subject areas: property testing, social choice, cryptography, circuit complexity, learning theory, pseudorandomness, hardness of approximation, concrete complexity, and random graph theory. The book can be used as a reference for working researchers or as the basis of a one-semester graduate-level course. The author has twice taught such a course at Carnegie Mellon University, attended mainly by graduate students in computer science and mathematics but also by advanced undergraduates, postdocs, and researchers in adjacent fields. In both years most of Chapters 1-5 and 7 were covered, along with parts of Chapters 6, 8, 9, and 11, and some additional material on additive combinatorics. Nearly 500 exercises are provided at the ends of the book's chapters.},

	abstract = {Existing, fault tree linking models and large, event tree linking models for nuclear power plants are so large that they challenge computer memory limits and/or require excessive run times to fully quantify at the frequency cut-offs required for convergence. In some software quantification tools, the amount of frequency cut-off is not known, and for others, the sheer size of the models becomes unwieldy. The conceptual approach described here is to make use of Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation is one which treats a series of initiating event challenges to the logic model as constants and each challenge assesses whether the logic model end states are true or not. The logic model may be a single fault tree, a single event tree with branch probabilities, or a combination of fault trees and event trees. The outcomes of each challenge are tallied at the end of the simulation to obtain conditional end state probabilities and then combined with the initiating event frequencies to obtain accident sequence frequencies. Quantification cut-offs are not used for this approach and there are no restrictions on the use of NOT gates. Convergence of the Monte Carlo simulation would be the main issue.},

The purpose of this paper is therefore to show an algorithm to speed up Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing fault tree with parallel computing in GPU. To this end, we use time-to-failure tree to model fault tree with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is used to accelerate the execution of loops with many repetitions. We also use this technique to accelerate Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we visualize fault tree so that the user is able to generate fault tree in detail using our developed software and can execute it. The computational outcomes validate the effectiveness of the suggested approach, as we approached about 310 times speedup in large fault trees.},

            While automation technologies advance faster than ever, gaps of resilience capabilities between autonomous and human-operated systems have not yet been identified and addressed appropriately. To date, there exists no generic framework for resilience assessment that is applicable to a broad spectrum of domains or able to take into account the impacts on mission-scenario-level resilience from system-specific attributes. In the proposed framework, resilience is meant to describe the ability of a system, in an open range of adverse scenarios, to maintain normal operating conditions or to recover from degraded or failed states in order to provide anticipated functions or services to achieve mission success. The term resilience is introduced in relation with classical terms such as fault, error, failure, fault-tolerance, reliability, and risk. The proposed model-based resilience assessment framework is based on a resilience ontology that enables the use of system models into reliability and risk models for transparent, persistent, and up-to-date modeling and quantification. A SysML profile and associated OWL ontology are defined to enable the use of a range of resilience mechanisms into the design and operation of a system.},

            Advanced classical Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) effectively combines various methods for quantitative risk evaluation, such as event trees, fault trees, and Bayesian networks. PRA methods and tools provide the means for the qualitative reliability evaluation (e.g., cut sets) and the computation of quantitative reliability metrics (e.g., end states probabilities). Modern safety-critical systems from various industrial domains tend toward a high level of autonomy and demand not only reliability but also resilience, the ability to recover from degraded or failed states. The numerical resilience analysis of such dynamic systems requires more flexible methods. These methods shall enable the analysis of the systems with sophisticated software parts and dynamic feedback loops. A suitable candidate is the Dual-graph Error Propagation Model (DEPM) that can capture nontrivial failure scenarios and dynamic fault-tolerance mechanisms. The DEPM exploits the method for the automatic generation of Markov chain models and the application of probabilistic model checking techniques. Moreover, the DEPM enables the analysis of highly-customizable system resilience metrics, e.g., “the probability of system recovery to a particular state after a specified system failure during a defined time interval.” In this paper, we show how DEPM-based resilience analysis can be integrated with the general PRA methodology for resilience evaluations. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a safety-critical autonomous UAV system.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Modern technical systems consist of heterogeneous components, including mechanical parts, hardware, and the extensive software part that allows the autonomous system operation. The heterogeneity and autonomy require appropriate models that can describe the mutual interaction of the components. uml and sysml are widely accepted candidates for system modeling and model-based analysis in early design phases, including the analysis of reliability properties. uml and sysml models are semiformal. Thus, transformation methods to formal models are required. Recently, we introduced a stochastic dual-graph error propagation model (DEPM). This model captures the control and data flow structures of a system and allows the computation of advanced risk metrics using probabilistic model checking techniques. This article presents a new automated transformation method of an annotated state machine diagram (SMD), extended with activity diagrams (ADs), to a hierarchical DEPM. This method will help reliability engineers to keep error propagation models up to date and ensure their consistency with the available system models. The capabilities and limitations of the transformation algorithm are described in detail and demonstrated on a complete model-based error propagation analysis of an autonomous medical patient table (MPT).},

	abstract = {This paper conducts a focused probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) on the reliability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) drones deployed for surveillance in areas with diverse radiation levels following a nuclear accident. The study employs the event tree/fault tree digraph approach, integrated with the dual-graph error propagation method (DEPM), to model sequences that could lead to loss of mission (LOM) scenarios due to combined hardware–software failures in the drone’s navigation system. The impact of radiation is simulated by a comparison of the total ionizing dose (TID) with the acceptable limit for each component. Errors are then propagated within the electronic hardware and software blocks to determine the navigation system’s reliability in different radiation zones. If the system is deemed unreliable, a strategy is suggested to identify the minimum radiation-hardening requirement for its subcomponents by reverse-engineering from the desired mission success criteria. The findings of this study can aid in the integration of COTS components into radiation-hardened (RAD-HARD) designs, optimizing the balance between cost, performance, and reliability in drone systems for nuclear-contaminated search and rescue missions.},

However, the gained fault tolerance comes along with costs to be invested, e.g., increasing execution time, energy consumption, or packaging size, for which constraints have to be obeyed during system design. This turns the question of finding suitable combinations of components to be protected into a challenging task as the number of possible protection combinations grows exponentially in the number of components. We propose family-based approaches to tackle the combinatorial blowup in redundancy systems modeling and analysis phases. Based on systems designed in SIMULINK we show how to obtain models that include all possible protection combinations and present a tool chain that, given a probabilistic error model, generates discrete Markov chain families. Using symbolic techniques that enable concise family representation and analysis, we show how SIMULINK models of realistic size can be protected and analyzed with a single family-based analysis run while a one-by-one analysis of each protection combination would clearly exceed any realistic time constraints.},

In an impassioned, manic monologue this character, plagued by shame, guilt, and alienation, argues that reason is merely a flimsy construction built upon humanity's essentially irrational core. Internal conflict is also explored in \&\#147;The Double, a surreal tale of a government clerk who meets a more unpleasant version of himself and is changed as a result.In addition to these two existential classics, this collection also includes the psychologically probing stories \&\#147;The Meek One, \&\#147;The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and \&\#147;White Nights.Deborah A.

What happens to you when you can't walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As the author discovers, it's possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth.

The winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world. Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man's mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain. Crafted with unforgettable characters, Roanhorse has created an epic adventure exploring the decadence of power amidst the weight of history and the struggle of individuals swimming against the confines of society and their broken pasts in this original series debut. --From publisher description},

	abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros (“nonevents”). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

	doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.1905.11881},
	abstract = {We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of gradient clipping in training deep neural networks. The key ingredient is a new smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples. We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant, demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two popular methods, namely, {\textbackslash}emph\{gradient clipping\} and {\textbackslash}emph\{normalized gradient\}, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular neural network training settings.},

Two general approaches are to vary the window width by the point of estimation and by point of the sample observation. The first possibility is shown to be of little efficacy in one variable. In particular, nearest-neighbor estimators in all versions perform poorly in one and two dimensions, but begin to be useful in three or more variables. The second possibility is more promising. We give some general properties and then focus on the popular Abramson estimator. We show that in many practical situations, such as normal data, a nonlocality phenomenon limits the commonly applied version of the Abramson estimator to bias of O([ h / log h]2) instead of the hoped for O(h4).},

This hyperparameter is usually chosen by trial and error with a model selection criterion. In this article we present a methodology to optimize several hyper-parameters, based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters. In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters is efficiently computed by backpropagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion.},

Yet, there remains enduring confusion over their use, such that a standard practice is to present both, leaving it to the reader to decide which is more relevant. In a recent reprise to the 200-year debate over their use, Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Chai and Draxler (2014) give arguments for favoring one metric or the other. However, this comparison can present a false dichotomy. Neither metric is inherently better: RMSE is optimal for normal (Gaussian) errors, and MAE is optimal for Laplacian errors. When errors deviate from these distributions, other metrics are superior.},

In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We describe an efficient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance of relation-aware self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graph-labeled inputs.},

Moreover, due to DNNs' rich capacity, errors in training labels can hamper performance. To combat this problem, mean absolute error (MAE) has recently been proposed as a noise-robust alternative to the commonly-used categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. However, as we show in this paper, MAE can perform poorly with DNNs and challenging datasets. Here, we present a theoretically grounded set of noise-robust loss functions that can be seen as a generalization of MAE and CCE. Proposed loss functions can be readily applied with any existing DNN architecture and algorithm, while yielding good performance in a wide range of noisy label scenarios. We report results from experiments conducted with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FASHION-MNIST datasets and synthetically generated noisy labels.},

	abstract = {Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a fully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure transformer (ie, without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR). Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K (50.28\% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83\% mIoU) and competitive results on Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly competitive ADE20K test server leaderboard on the day of submission.},

	abstract = {Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.},

Therefore, a conservative uncertainty treatment is beneficial to assure a reliable and safe design. The present paper explores the applicability of DST which merges interval-based and probabilistic uncertainty modelling on a fault tree analysis from the automotive area. The system under investigation, an automatic transmission from the ZF AS Tronic series is still in the development stage. Expert estimates and the Monte Carlo propagation of the resulting mass function through the system model are used to obtain the uncertainty on the system failure probability. An exploratory sensitivity based on a non-specifity measure indicates which components contribute to the overall model uncertainty. The results are used to predict if the system complies with a given target failure measure.},

	abstract = {Approaches based on Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results for multiobjective integer programming problems. The variable ordering used in constructing BDDs can have a significant impact on their size and on the quality of bounds derived from relaxed or restricted BDDs for single-objective optimization problems. We first showcase a similar impact of variable ordering on the Pareto frontier (PF) enumeration time for the multiobjective knapsack problem, suggesting the need for deriving variable ordering methods that improve the scalability of the multiobjective BDD approach. To that end, we derive a novel parameter configuration space based on variable scoring functions which are linear in a small set of interpretable and easy-to-compute variable features. We show how the configuration space can be efficiently explored using black-box optimization, circumventing the curse of dimensionality (in the number of variables and objectives), and finding good orderings that reduce the PF enumeration time. However, black-box optimization approaches incur a computational overhead that outweighs the reduction in time due to good variable ordering. To alleviate this issue, we propose LEO, a supervised learning approach for finding efficient variable orderings that reduce the enumeration time. Experiments on benchmark sets from the knapsack problem with 3-7 objectives and up to 80 variables show that LEO is {\textasciitilde}30-300\% and {\textasciitilde}10-200\% faster at PF enumeration than common ordering strategies and algorithm configuration.

	abstract = {Prescriptive analytics provides organizations with scalable solutions for large-scale, automated decision making. At the core of prescriptive analytics methodology is optimization, a field devoted to the study of algorithms that solve complex decision-making problems. Optimization algorithms rely heavily on generic methods for identifying tight bounds, which provide both solutions to problems and optimality guarantees. In the last decade, decision diagrams (DDs) have demonstrated significant advantages in obtaining bounds compared with the standard linear relaxation commonly used by commercial solvers. However, the quality of the bounds computed by DDs depends heavily on the variable ordering chosen for the construction. Besides, the problem of finding an ordering that optimizes a given metric is generally NP-hard. This paper studies how machine learning, specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL), can be used to improve bounds provided by DDs, in particular through learning a good variable ordering. The introduced DRL models improve primal and dual bounds, even over standard linear programming relaxations, and are integrated in a full-fledged branch-and-bound algorithm. This paper, therefore, provides a novel mechanism for utilizing machine learning to tighten bounds, adding to recent research on using machine learning to obtain high-quality heuristic solutions and, for the first time, using machine learning to improve relaxation bounds through a generic bounding method. We apply the methods on a classic optimization problem, the maximum independent set, and demonstrate through computational testing that optimization bounds can be significantly improved through DRL. We provide the code to replicate the results obtained on the maximum independent set.
            Summary of Contribution: This paper studies the use of reinforcement learning to compute a variable ordering of decision diagram-based approximations for discrete optimization problems. This is among the first works to propose the use of machine learning to improve upon generic bounding methods for discrete optimization problems, thereby establishing a critical bridge between optimization and learning.},

	abstract = {Finding tight bounds on the optimal solution is a critical element of practical solution methods for discrete optimization problems. In the last decade, decision diagrams (DDs) have brought a new perspective on obtaining upper and lower bounds that can be significantly better than classical bounding mechanisms, such as linear relaxations. It is well known that the quality of the bounds achieved through this flexible bounding method is highly reliant on the ordering of variables chosen for building the diagram, and finding an ordering that optimizes standard metrics is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose an innovative and generic approach based on deep reinforcement learning for obtaining an ordering for tightening the bounds obtained with relaxed and restricted DDs. We apply the approach to both the Maximum Independent Set Problem and the Maximum Cut Problem. Experimental results on synthetic instances show that the deep reinforcement learning approach, by achieving tighter objective function bounds, generally outperforms ordering methods commonly used in the literature when the distribution of instances is known. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper to apply machine learning to directly improve relaxation bounds obtained by general-purpose bounding mechanisms for combinatorial optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Many industrial sectors have been collecting big sensor data. With recent technologies for processing big data, companies can exploit this for automatic failure detection and prevention. We propose the first completely automated method for failure analysis, machine-learning fault trees from raw observational data with continuous variables. Our method scales well and is tested on a real-world, five-year dataset of domestic heater operations in The Netherlands, with 31 million unique heater-day readings, each containing 27 sensor and 11 failure variables. Our method builds on two previous procedures: the C4.5 decision-tree learning algorithm, and the LIFT fault tree learning algorithm from Boolean data. C4.5 pre-processes each continuous variable: it learns an optimal numerical threshold which distinguishes between faulty and normal operation of the top-level system. These thresholds discretise the variables, thus allowing LIFT to learn fault trees which model the root failure mechanisms of the system and are explainable. We obtain fault trees for the 11 failure variables, and evaluate them in two ways: quantitatively, with a significance score, and qualitatively, with domain specialists. Some of the fault trees learnt have almost maximum significance (above 0.95), while others have medium-to-low significance (around 0.30), reflecting the difficulty of learning from big, noisy, real-world sensor data. The domain specialists confirm that the fault trees model meaningful relationships among the variables.},

All of this material is general enough that it could be used in non-nuclear applications, although there is an emphasis placed on the analysis of nuclear systems. The second half of the book covers the safety analysis of nuclear energy systems, an analysis of major accidents and incidents that occurred in commercial nuclear plants, applications of PRA techniques to the safety analysis of nuclear power plants (focusing on a major PRA study for five nuclear power plants), practical PRA examples, and emerging techniques in the structure of dynamic event trees and fault trees that can provide a more realistic representation of complex sequences of events. The book concludes with a discussion on passive safety features of advanced nuclear energy systems under development and approaches taken for risk-informed regulations for nuclear plants.},

	url = {https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Space-Telecommunications-Systems-Engineering/dp/1495250768},
	abstract = {A vital, often predominant function in every space mission is that of communications. From the moment of launch, the only connection between spacecraft and earth is the communications system. This system is responsible for sending scientific data back to earth in the specified quality and quantity together with engineering data reporting the condition of the spacecraft. The communications system also provides the capability of tracking the spacecraft and commanding it to take certain actions. Without an effective communications system a successful mission would not be possible. To appreciate the challenge that one faces in designing such systems for planetary exploration, one must consider the enormous distances that are involved. Voyager spacecraft, for example, are now more than one billion miles from earth, tens of thousands of times farther than the most distant communications satellite, and continue to transmit data and respond to commands. The necessity of minimizing spacecraft weight presents a major problem to communications systems designers. The far-reaching implications of spacecraft weight become apparent as the designer considers the problems of providing power supply, antennas, and other necessary devices and supporting elements. Another important challenge is the extreme reliability required of the communications system on the spacecraft. Once the spacecraft is launched, on-board failures can no longer be repaired except by use of redundant systems. System degradation due to aging, imperfect antenna pointing, or imperfect trajectories can be expected; and the designer must know how much degradation to expect from each case and must design the equipment, the operations, and the procedures of data analysis accordingly. The telecommunications engineer works with the most precise and advanced techniques of the engineering world. Since the launch in 1958 of Explorer I, the first free-world satellite, there has been substantial progress in improving communications capability. Even though substantial progress has been made in the last 25 years, space exploration is still in its infancy. There has been no exploration beyond the solar system. There are numerous galaxies and billions of stars to investigate. Bigger and tougher challenges are still ahead; more exciting times are yet to come. These challenges will undoubtedly call for more advanced telecommunications systems to transmit information to and from deep space. Telecommunications technology is still in its infancy. Through the years, a number of telecommunications design techniques, procedures, and analyses contributing to the success of deep space exploration missions have been developed and applied. The purpose of this book is to provide descriptive and analytical information useful for the optimum design, specification, and performance evaluation of deep space telecommunications systems. The book emphasizes system performance information. Long, tedious derivations are not included. The book should serve to acquaint new telecommunications engineers with the techniques available to them and should summarize for the experienced engineers the analyses and information necessary for their work. It also provides a background for understanding the interface between the Deep Space Network and the spacecraft and is intended to facilitate the conceptual designs and analyses for the enhancement of telecommunications performance and assurance of compatibility between spacecraft and ground system capabilities.},

LWRs are the predominant nuclear reactor in use around the world today, and they will continue to be the most frequently utilized in the near future. Therefore, accurate determination of the safety issues associated with such reactors is central to a consideration of the risks and benefits of nuclear power. This book emphasizes the prevention and management of severe accidents, in order to teach nuclear professionals how to mitigate potential risks to the public to the maximum extent possible. Engineers, researchers, students and the personnel of vendors, safety authorities and nuclear power generation organizations require the knowledge offered by this volume's globally renowned experts to ensure they obtain a core competency in nuclear safety.
